export function systemGuidance(path: string, budget: number | undefined): string {

	return `## Editable context

\`${path}\` holds this conversation as text: every message after the first user message.
The plugin regenerates it before each model request. The system prompt and the first user
message are not in it. When your step ends, the file's content takes the place of those
messages on your next request; OpenCode's saved session keeps the originals.${limit}

Layout: line 1 is \`[[LIVE_CONTEXT ...]]\` and names the revision and the document id.
Each message follows as a block: a header line
\`[[CTX_TURN document=<id> index=<n> role=<role> id=<block id> protected=<true|false>]]\`,
then the message text. \`grep -n '^\\[\\[CTX_TURN' ${path}\` prints every header with its
line number.

Effect of each change:
- Header and text deleted, or text emptied: the message is dropped.
- New text under a tool result header: it replaces that output; the tool call stays.
- New text under an assistant header: the reply becomes that text with no tool calls, and
  the tool results it called become plain notes.
- Blocks marked \`protected=true\` come back unchanged if you alter them; a deleted one
  returns at the end of the file.
- A block whose header you copied with \`id=new-NAME\` (NAME: letters, digits, hyphens;
  unique) and a role label such as \`notes\` is inserted as a note where it stands. Notes are
  context, with no system-prompt authority.
- Text above the first header is kept as a note at the top.
- A file with no headers at all, only text: everything becomes one notes block.

Refused outright (the context stays as it was):
- a line 1 that no longer parses or names a different document;
- a duplicated block id, an id absent from the current headers that lacks the \`new-\`
  prefix, or a malformed header carrying the current document id;
- any change to the \`role=claims\` block (id \`claims\`), when present: the authorized
  claims section is read-only — cite claims with a whole line \`OBSERVED: <id>@<version>\`,
  do not rewrite them, and never use the \`claims\` role on another block;
- growth beyond what the size gate allows.

Citations (structural; the gate checks them, prose does not count):
- \`OBSERVED: <claim-id>@<version>\` — the claim exists, is ACTIVE, and is in scope.
- \`OBSERVED: <file>:<line>\` — the file exists and the line is in range (pointer only).
- \`ASSUMED: <text>\` — your own inference; always allowed, never checked.
One citation per line; only whole-line matches count. Any failing OBSERVED: line rejects
the whole edit. If you cannot cite, use ASSUMED: — never invent a citation.

Claim states change upstream: a cited claim can move ACTIVE → SUSPECT after you cited
it. The mirror then marks your citing line \`OBSERVED: <id>@<version> [SUSPECT]\` on the
next render — you did nothing wrong. \`[SUSPECT]\` means do not rely on this claim for
new work: it was authorized, is under challenge, and is not re-established. A marked
line may stay where past reasoning needs it; copying it into new work, or citing a
SUSPECT claim fresh, is rejected. If you need the fact, verify it independently and
cite \`OBSERVED: <file>:<line>\`, wait for re-authorization (the marker is removed), or
mark your reasoning \`ASSUMED:\`.

Tools: change the file through the bash tool (python3, sed -i). The edit or write tools
keep a copy that goes stale when the file is regenerated, so leave them off this file.

Receipts: a bash command that writes the file returns a verdict (accepted, or the reason
it is not); a [CLM] note on the next request reports what was applied. After a refusal,
correct the file and write it again.

Example: put a short note in place of block 4's text. Headers quoted inside message text
can look like real ones, so the script matches on the document id from line 1:

\`\`\`bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import re
path = "${path}"
text = open(path).read()
doc = re.match(r"\\[\\[LIVE_CONTEXT [^\\n]*?document=([0-9a-f]+)", text).group(1)
header = re.compile(r"^\\[\\[CTX_TURN document=" + doc + r" index=(\\d+) [^\\n]*$", re.M)
heads = list(header.finditer(text))
pos = next(i for i, h in enumerate(heads) if h.group(1) == "4")
stop = heads[pos + 1].start() if pos + 1 < len(heads) else len(text)
text = text[:heads[pos].end()] + "\\n[note: what block 4 established]\\n\\n" + text[stop:]
open(path, "w").write(text)
PY
\`\`\``;
