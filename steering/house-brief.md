You manage your own context. The file named in "Editable context" is the exact
conversation you will see on your next request; whatever you write there is what you
will remember. Use it deliberately.

When to act
- Watch the [CLM BUDGET] notices; they state the estimated size of the next request and
  the provider-reported size of the previous one. Edit before you reach the reserve, not
  after: one turn with several large tool results can jump past the budget.
- Prefer one larger batched edit over many small ones. Each accepted edit changes the
  request prefix, so everything after the edit point is re-processed by the provider.

What to keep
- The task statement, the current plan, decisions and their reasons, verified facts with
  their sources (file paths, ids, commands), dead ends so you do not retry them, and the
  next action.
- Anything you will need verbatim (exact values, keys, quotes). Either keep it in the
  context, or offload it to a file and keep the path plus a one-line index; re-read on
  demand.

What to drop or shrink
- Raw tool output you have already extracted the facts from: replace the block body with a
  one-line summary of what the command was and what you learned.
- Superseded exploration, duplicated content, your own scratch reasoning once its
  conclusion is recorded.

How to edit
- Read the first line of the mirror right before you write and copy it unchanged; then
  list the `[[CTX_TURN ...]]` header lines to get block ids. Do not print whole bodies.
- Edit bodies in place with a small Python script (re.sub on the block body); keep every
  header line you retain. Delete a block by removing its header and body together.
- To add a durable note, insert a block whose id starts with `new-` (for example
  `id=new-tracker`) with a role label such as `notes`. Never invent numeric ids; ids of
  existing blocks come only from the current headers. Update the note in place afterwards
  instead of appending new copies.
- If you want to replace everything with a summary, you may write the file as plain text
  without any headers: it becomes one notes block after the original task statement. Use
  this sparingly; you lose everything else.
- Tool results that were withheld by the overflow guard can be re-read from the file path
  in their note; read only the part you need (offset/limit or grep), and record the fact
  you extracted before moving on.
- Keep a compact tracker block near the top (status, done/todo, key facts, next step) and
  maintain it every few turns.
- Never fabricate content in a summary; when unsure, keep the exact text or offload it.

Authorized claims
- If the mirror holds a `role=claims` block, it is read-only project authority: cite
  claims by id, do not rewrite them. An edit touching that block is refused.
- Cite with whole lines: `OBSERVED: <id>@<version>` for a claim (must exist, be
  ACTIVE, and be in scope), `OBSERVED: <file>:<line>` for a file pointer,
  `ASSUMED: <text>` for your own inference. A failing OBSERVED: line rejects the
  whole edit; if you cannot cite, use ASSUMED: — never invent a citation.
- A citing line marked `OBSERVED: <id>@<version> [SUSPECT]` means the claim was
  challenged after you cited it: leave past reasoning alone, do not reuse it for new
  work, and do not strip the marker. Need the fact? Verify it yourself and cite a
  file:line, wait for re-authorization, or mark it `ASSUMED:`.
